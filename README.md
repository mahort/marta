### Assigning taxonomic status to short read sequences 
Authors: Matt Horton,

This Java program uses a local NCBI nt/nr database to assign taxonomic status to short-read sequences.
The algorithm was described [earlier] (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/4/568/243101).

The current version is 1.0. Suggestions and code contributions are welcome.

The main dependencies are:
